# COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis

This project analyzes the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data from the World Health Organization (WHO). It provides insights into confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and trends across countries and continents through data visualization and analysis.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people globally. This analysis focuses on understanding the spread, severity, and outcomes of the pandemic through visual storytelling and comparative studies.

Key components include:

- Total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and continent
- Time-series trend analysis
- Comparative bar charts and heatmaps
- Top 10 countries based on various metrics

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Key Findings

- The United States, India, and Brazil reported the highest number of confirmed cases.
- Europe experienced some of the earliest and most intense death rates.
- Several countries with early interventions managed to limit death rates significantly.

The notebook includes visualizations to explore these findings in detail.

## Sample Visualizations

- Heatmaps of global case distribution
- Line plots of daily confirmed and death trends
- Bar charts comparing countries and continents
